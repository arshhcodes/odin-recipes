    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna also known as lasagne, Italian is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices.The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <p>Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials"), in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery).It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagna, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets, boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>

        <li>8 sheets fresh pasta, 11 x 33 cm (4 1/2 x 13 in) each</li>
        <li>150 ml (2/3 cup) olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 can 796 ml (28 oz) diced plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>300 g (2/3 lb) spinach leaves, washed, blanched and cooled</li>
        <li>125 ml (1/2 cup) shelled, unsalted pistachio nuts</li>
        <li>250 ml (1 cup) Saputo grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>30 ml (2 tbsp) water</li>
        <li>300 g (2/3 lb) boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1.5 cm (1/2 in) cubes</li>
        <li>475 g (1 container) Saputo Ricotta Fiorella</li>
        <li>180 g (6 oz) Saputo Provolone cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180˚C / 350˚F.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and run under cold water. Drain again and toss with 30 ml (2 tbsp) of oil. Reserve.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat 30 ml (2 tbsp) of oil on medium heat, add the onions and garlic and cook 4 minutes until soft but not browned. Add the tomatoes, bring to a boil, season with pepper and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Gently squeeze the spinach to extract the excess water. Chop the spinach coarsely; you should have about 180 ml (3/4 cup).</li>
        <li>In a food processor or using a hand blender, purée the spinach, pistachios, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, the water and 60 ml (1/4 cup) of the oil. Blend until smooth, adding a bit more water, if necessary.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat 30 ml (2 tbsp) of oil. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and fry for 2 minutes, stirring often, until the meat is white all over. Combine the chicken with the spinach mixture.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the Ricotta with the remaining Parmesan and mix well. Season to taste.</li>
        <li>In a 22 x 33 cm (9 x 13 in) rectangular baking dish, spread 1/3 of the tomato sauce. Layer the dish as follows: 2 pasta sheets, the Ricotta mixture, 2 more pasta sheets, 1/3 of the tomato sauce, 2 more pasta sheets, the chicken pesto mixture, 1/2 of the Provolone cheese, 2 pasta sheets, the remaining 1/3 of the tomato sauce and the rest of the cheese.</li>
