# odin-recipes
First project ever!!

This is my first ever project learning web development. So far, I have covered basics of HTML and will try applying those skills in this project. 

This project will cover making basic webpage(nothing fancy!) for some of the food recipes. 
Also, I will keep on updating this webpage as I keep on learning new concepts.
